## Delicious Spinach Dish

Prep time: 20 minutes

### ingredients

- 1 pound of ground sausage
- 1 bulb of garlic, diced
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 1 brick or bag of frozen chopped spinach
- 1 can of cream of mushroom soup
- 2 cups of rice

### Directions

Start cooking the rice in a separate pan or rice cooker or whatever. If you're a rockstar, you'll add half a stick of butter to it because fuck yeah.

Brown the sausage in a large pan on medium heat. When brown, add the onion and the garlic. When the onions are translucent, add the frozen spinach, and the can of cream of mushroom soup. Reduce the heat to medium low, and give the spinach some time to thaw. Stir every few minutes, until everything is well mixed and hot.
